# Introduction
For years, FiveM stood as one of the greatest testaments to what a dedicated community can achieve. It was more than just a multiplayer modification for *Grand Theft Auto V*, it was a platform that empowered players, server owners, and developers to build something beyond the confines of Rockstar’s vision.

But as history has shown time and time again, when something great thrives outside corporate control, it doesn’t take long for corporate interests to sink their claws into it.

## The Rise of FiveM
FiveM was founded on the principles of freedom and creativity. It allowed players to create their own multiplayer experiences, from realistic roleplay servers to completely custom game modes. Unlike Rockstar’s official GTA Online, FiveM wasn’t constrained by microtransactions or corporate oversight, it was driven by the people who built and played on it.

And it was wildly successful. It grew into one of the most popular modding platforms in gaming, drawing millions of players and spawning massive roleplaying communities like NoPixel. The original FiveM developers weren’t just maintaining a mod, they were leading a revolution in how GTA could be played.

## The Rockstar Acquisition: A Turning Point
Then came the moment that changed everything. In 2023, Rockstar Games acquired `Cfx.re`, the team behind FiveM. On the surface, this looked like a win. Some hoped that with Rockstar’s support, FiveM could finally operate without the looming threat of legal action. Maybe, just maybe, this would be a new era for the platform.

**But those hopes were short lived.**  

What followed was a textbook example of corporate destruction. One by one, the original developers who built FiveM from the ground up were either pushed out or left voluntarily as the platform’s direction shifted. The open, community driven project they had worked so hard to create was now under the control of Rockstar, an entity with no real interest in modding beyond how it could be monetized.

## The Mismanagement & Decline
According to [fivem.team](https://fivem.team), an exposé detailing the inner turmoil at FiveM, the post acquisition period was marked by:

- Internal conflicts that drove key developers away  
- Poor leadership that disregarded the project’s original vision  
- Questionable business decisions that prioritized corporate interests over the community  

As time passed, it became clear that Rockstar wasn’t interested in preserving FiveM’s spirit. Instead, they saw it as a product to be controlled, sanitized, and eventually profited from.

## The Death of What Made FiveM Special
Today, FiveM is a shadow of what it once was. Many of the most talented individuals behind its success are gone. The sense of community and creative freedom that defined it has been eroded.

And for what? A sterilized version of what FiveM once was, stripped of its independence and passion.

But here’s the thing: **the spirit of FiveM doesn’t live within Rockstar.** It lives in the developers, server owners, and players who refuse to let innovation die. It lives in the countless projects that were inspired by FiveM’s success. And as long as there are communities willing to fight for creative freedom, there will always be alternatives no matter how much corporations try to shut them down.

## Why I’m Stepping Away from FiveM
I’ve been involved in the FiveM development and modding community for a long time, but after everything that has happened, I can’t continue to support what it has become. The FiveM that once stood for creativity, independence, and innovation is gone, replaced by a hollow shell controlled by a company that cares more about profits than the people who made it successful in the first place.

**This isn’t the community I joined. This isn’t the vision I believed in.** And I refuse to be a part of something that no longer aligns with what made FiveM special.

So, as of today, I’m officially stepping away from FiveM development and modding. I’ll always appreciate the experiences and friendships I built along the way, but it’s time to move forward.

For anyone interested, all of my FiveM mods and resources are open-source on my [GitHub](https://github.com/TheRealToxicDev) and my organization [Toxic Development](https://github.com/toxic-development). Do with them what you wish.

## Standing With the Original FiveM Founders
I stand with the original FiveM developers. They built something truly groundbreaking, only to watch it be taken from them. Their story is yet another reminder that when corporations get involved, passion projects rarely stay passion projects for long.

But their impact? **That’s something Rockstar can’t buy, control, or erase.**  

If you want to know the full story, check out [fivem.team](https://fivem.team). And if you’re a developer, creator, or player who values independence, support the people who built the communities you love.

Because in the end, **it’s not the corporations that make gaming great. It’s the people.**

## What’s Next for Me?

Although I’m stepping away from FiveM, I’m not stepping away from development. I’ll continue working on open-source projects, contributing to communities that value innovation, and focusing on tools that give developers real control over their creations.
